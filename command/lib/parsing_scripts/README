'''
The Experiment Object, Platform Object and Sample Object are Python objects used as proxy to import a new experiment in the database

The file name of the experiment, platform or sample is stored in the variable named INPUT_FILE
The name of the entity (experiment, platform or sample name) is stored in the variable named ENTITY_NAME
To access parameters passed to each script use the list PARAMETERS
Within each entity (experiment, platform or sample) you can choose the execution order of the script using the Order column.

To access Experiment Object use the EXPERIMENT_OBJECT variable in the Python script used with experiment files.

EXPERIMENT_OBJECT variables
EXPERIMENT_OBJECT.experiment_access_id: (string) the experiment access id
EXPERIMENT_OBJECT.experiment_name: (string) the experiment name
EXPERIMENT_OBJECT.scientific_paper_ref: (string) pubblication associated to the experiment
EXPERIMENT_OBJECT.description: (string) the experiment description

To access Platform Object use the PLATFORM_OBJECT variable in the Python script used with platform files.

PLATFORM_OBJECT variables
PLATFORM_OBJECT.platform_access_id (string) the platform access id
PLATFORM_OBJECT.platform_name (string) the platform name
PLATFORM_OBJECT.platform_type (string) 'microarray or rna-seq'
PLATFORM_OBJECT.description (string) the platform description
PLATFORM_OBJECT.add_bio_feature_reporter_data(name, description, **kwargs): add a reporter to the platform
**kwargs are platform_type dependent. i.e. for 'microarray' they are probe_access_id,
probe_set_name, probe_type and sequence

To access Sample Object use the SAMPLE_OBJECT variable in the Python script used with sample files.

SAMPLE_OBJECT variables and methods
SAMPLE_OBJECT.sample_name (string) the sample name
SAMPLE_OBJECT.description (string) the sample description
SAMPLE_OBJECT.add_raw_data(bio_feature_reporter_name, value): add raw data of this sample
