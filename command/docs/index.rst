Welcome to COMMAND>_'s documentation!
=====================================

COMMAND>_ is a web-based application used to download, collect and manage gene expression data from public databases.

Main features are.


* Easy installation and update using `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_ technology.
* Graphical User Interface (GUI) for parsing and importing gene expression data.
* Default `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ scripts for easy parsing/importing of the most common microarray platforms (Affymetrix, Nimblegen, two-colors, etc.) and dedicated scripting editor for allowing flexible importing of any kind of gene expression data.
* Automatic pre-processing (downloading, trimming, mapping and counting) of bulk RNA-Seq data.
* Exporting of the collected data.
